Information: Timer using 'CRPR'. (TIM-050)
Information: The stitching and editing of coupling caps is turned OFF for design 'RISCV_Top.dlib:Routing.design'. (TIM-125)
Information: Design Routing has 2079 nets, 0 global routed, 2077 detail routed. (NEX-024)
Warning: Technology layer 'MRDL' setting 'routing-direction' is not valid (NEX-001)
Information: Advanced receiver model has not been enabled for detailed routed design. (TIM-204)
Information: Update timing completed net estimation for all the timing graph nets (TIM-111)
Information: Net estimation statistics: timing graph nets = 1989, routed nets = 1989, across physical hierarchy nets = 0, parasitics cached nets = 1989, delay annotated nets = 0, parasitics annotated nets = 0, multi-voltage nets = 2. (TIM-112)
